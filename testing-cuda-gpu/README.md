# Creating Python Virtual Environment to make a simple test, using pytorch, whether cuda and gpu is working:

## Python Virtual Environment:

1. Checking python version:

        python --version or python3 --version

2. Checking if venv installed:

    Usually, Python 3.3 to above the venv comes together.

         python -m venv --help

    If not just install running the following

        sudo apt-get install python3.x-venv

3. Creating an virtual environment:

    Choose the directory that you want to develop and digit the following command

            python -m venv environment_name

4. Activating the virtual environment:

    Window:

         environment_name\Scripts\activate

    MacOs/Linux:

         source environment_name/bin/activate

5. Now, you can install, using pip, fastapi package:

    Before to install packages

        python -m pip install --upgrade pip

    If you have a requirements.txt, just copy it inside of virtual environment directory and run following command

         pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Freeze packages versions on the requirements.txt file:

    After installed packages that you need to your project is a good practice to freeze its in a requirements.txt files.

    To do it, you have, in first, digit

        pip freeze

    After this you have to create a requirements file and to make Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V about this file. Or, more fast

        pip freeze > requirements.txt
